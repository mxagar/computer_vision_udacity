## Introduction

AWS SageMaker Studio Lab is equivalent to Google Colab, but with the following differences:

- It is free.
- The UI is Jupyter lab itself, so we can install plugins, etc.
- We have access to the Terminal.
- We can create our own environments.
- The data persists even after closing the session; storage of 15 GB.
- We need to request access to it.
- We can also connect Github repositories.
- We can have one active project at a time.

AWS SageMaker Studio Lab accounts are separate from AWS accounts, and we need to request one:

[https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/)

The access should be granted in 1-5 business days.

If we need more or extended capabilities, we can easily switch to AWS SageMaker Studio.

## Usage

TBD.
