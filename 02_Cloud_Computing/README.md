# Cloud Computing

The original notes of the Cloud Computing module from the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) are located in 

[`CVND_CloudComputing.md`](./CVND_CloudComputing.md). 

However, I added more notes related to other cloud providers:

- [`Google_Colab_Notes.md`](./Google_Colab_Notes.md)
- [`IBM_Cloud_Notes.md`](./IBM_Cloud_Notes.md)

In any case, note that all **these notes on cloud services are very brief, practical and specific**. If you would like more in depth guides on clud services, I suggest checking these other notes of mine located in other repositories:

- [mxagar/azure_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/azure_guide)
- [mxagar/aws_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/aws_guide)
