# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree: Object Tracking and Localization

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

The nanodegree is composed of these modules:

1. Introduction to Computer Vision
2. Cloud Computing (Optional)
3. Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning
4. Object Tracking and Localization

Each module has a folder with its respective notes.
This folder/file refers to the **fourth** module: **Object Tracking and Localization**.

Note that:

- I have also notes on the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) in my repository [deep_learning_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/deep_learning_udacity); that MOOC is strongly related and has complementary material. I have many hand-written notes in [deep_learning_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/deep_learning_udacity) related to this repository, too.
- The exercises are commented in the Markdown files and linked to their location; most of the exercises are located in other repositories, originally forked from Udacity and extended/completed by me:
	- [CVND_Exercises](https://github.com/mxagar/CVND_Exercises)
	- [DL_PyTorch](https://github.com/mxagar/DL_PyTorch)
	- [CVND_Localization_Exercises](https://github.com/mxagar/CVND_Localization_Exercises)
	- [deep-learning-v2-pytorch](https://github.com/mxagar/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)

## Practical Installation Notes

I basically followed the installation & setup guide from [CVND_Exercises](https://github.com/mxagar/CVND_Exercises), which can be summarized with the following commands:

```bash
# Create new conda environment to be used for the nanodegree
conda create -n cvnd python=3.6
conda activate cvnd
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
conda install pip
#conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

# Go to the folder where the Udacity DL exercises are cloned, after forking the original repo
cd ~/git_repositories/CVND_Exercises
pip install -r requirements.txt

# I had some issues with numpy and torch
pip uninstall numpy
pip uninstall mkl-service
pip install numpy
pip install mkl-service
```
