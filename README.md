# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree: Personal Notes

These are my personal notes taken while following the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

The nanodegree is composed of six modules:

1. Introduction to Computer Vision
2. Cloud Computing (Optional)
3. Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning
4. Object Tracking and Localization
5. Extra Topics: C++ Programming

Each module has a folder with its respective notes.

Additionally, note that:
- I made many hand-written nortes, which I will scan and push to this repostory.
- I forked the Udacity repositors for the exercises; all the material and  notebooks are there:
	- [CVND_Exercises](https://github.com/mxagar/CVND_Exercises)
	- [DL_PyTorch](https://github.com/mxagar/DL_PyTorch)

## Practical Installation Notes

I basically followed the installation & setup guide from [CVND_Exercises](https://github.com/mxagar/CVND_Exercises), which can be summarized with the following commands:

```bash
# Create new conda environment to be used for the nanodegree
conda create -n cvnd python=3.6
conda activate cvnd
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
conda install pip
#conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
# Go to the folder where the Udacity DL exercises are cloned, after forking the original repo
cd ~/git_repositories/CVND_Exercises
pip install -r requirements.txt
# I had some issues with numpy and torch
pip uninstall numpy
pip uninstall mkl-service
pip install numpy
pip install mkl-service
```
